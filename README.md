- Dorian: Looking at vaccination rates by state
- Joey: Economic impact of COVID-19 by country
- Jaime: COVID-19 deaths during various stages of vaccination series
- Hannah: Comparing healthcare expenditure versus vaccination coverage

- Tell a story about why some regions handled COVID far better than others, and how structural factors, policy choices, and resource allocation shaped disease outcomes.

Your angle is essentially:
Vaccination outcomes were not just about individual behavior, but about state-level readiness, economic resilience, and health system investment.

That lets all four projects slot in naturally.

How to weave each person’s work into that story
1. Set the stage: What did vaccination rollouts look like across states?

Dorian’s part answers the opening question:
Who vaccinated faster? Who lagged? Which states climbed the coverage curve early?

This introduces the first key theme: heterogeneity. Nothing was uniform.

2. Connect vaccination patterns to global economic shock

Joey’s part zooms out: while US states varied in uptake, countries varied in economic resilience.

Tie it to the idea that:
Regions with stronger economies could implement broader public-health measures, sustain lockdowns, and support vaccination campaigns.
Weaker economies took heavier hits that shaped public willingness or ability to comply.

This builds a macro-context for the disparities.

3. Bring it back to outcomes: deaths across vaccination stages

Jaime’s part tackles the core public-health impact.
As vaccination levels changed, the mortality curve changed too.

This is your key pivot point:
“Vaccination patterns and economic conditions weren’t abstract. They literally changed who survived.”

Show how deaths stabilized or dropped once people reached certain doses.

4. Explain one major underlying driver: health expenditure

Your part wraps it all together:
States or countries with higher health expenditure tend to have stronger infrastructure, better outreach, and more equitable vaccine distribution.

Your plot answers the “why did outcomes diverge?” question:

High expenditure → better vaccine coverage → better outcomes

Low expenditure → patchier coverage → worse health and economic impacts

The overarching message

Something like:

COVID outcomes weren’t random. They reflected long term investments in public health, economic resilience, and healthcare systems. The data shows a clear chain: places with stronger health investment and economic stability achieved higher vaccination coverage, which directly reduced mortality.

Short, sharp, defensible.

Optional final slide idea

End with a clean story arc visual:

Variation in vaccination uptake (Dorian)

Macro-level economic context (Joey)

Downstream mortality outcomes (Jaime)

Structural driver: health spending (you)

It becomes:

Resources → Vaccination → Outcomes
