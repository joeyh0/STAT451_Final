- **Dorian:** Vaccination rates by state  
- **Joey:** Economic impact of COVID-19 by country  
- **Jaime:** COVID-19 deaths across stages of the vaccination series  
- **Hannah:** Healthcare expenditure vs vaccination coverage  

## Overview
This dashboard tells a unified story about **why some regions handled COVID far better than others**, and how **structural factors, economic resilience, and healthcare investment** shaped vaccination outcomes and mortality.

The central idea:
**Vaccination outcomes were not just about individual behavior, but about state-level readiness, economic conditions, and long term health system investment.**

## Story Structure

### 1. Vaccination Patterns Across States (Dorian)
We start by examining how vaccination rates varied across US states.  
Some states rolled out vaccines rapidly, while others lagged.  
This introduces the theme of **heterogeneity** in vaccine uptake.

### 2. Global Economic Impacts of COVID-19 (Joey)
Next, we zoom out to the international scale.  
Countries differed in how severely their economies were hit and how resilient they were.  
Economic strength shaped the capacity to support public health measures and vaccination campaigns.

### 3. COVID-19 Deaths Across Vaccination Stages (Jaime)
We then connect vaccination levels to mortality.  
As populations progressed through the vaccine series, death rates shifted significantly.  
This shows how vaccination disparities translated into **real health outcomes**.

### 4. Healthcare Expenditure vs Vaccination Coverage (Hannah)
Finally, we highlight one structural driver behind these differences.  
Regions with higher healthcare expenditures generally had stronger infrastructure, better access, and more consistent vaccination coverage.  
Lower investment regions saw patchier uptake and worse outcomes.

## Core Insight
**COVID outcomes weren’t random. They reflected long standing investments in public health, economic capacity, and healthcare systems.**

The data shows a clear progression:

**Resources → Vaccination → Mortality Outcomes**
