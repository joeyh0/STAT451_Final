Things to polish/adjust:

- Replacing Placeholder Text
- Ordering the tabs in an intuitive way (maybe not 100% needed for the assignment, but should think about it before presentation)
- Adding tab icons? 


More specific notes for each person:

Joey: 
- Probably need to update the axis title/titles to pop out more, kind of getting lost and is fading in background
- Maybe try to move around the maps to be on the same tab? Not sure yet

Dorian:
- Missing Scale on the US Vaccination Map? guessing you accidently deleted it :p happens
- On the same map New York is now greyed out b/c of a NA value? Not sure if this was a problem on the previous color scale?

Hannah:
- Adjusting the scatter plot to focus on a COVID Vaccination
- Maybe adding a feature on the data table tab where you can filter based on country, order by a column, etc. (I think the prof went over it in the
                                                                                                               2nd shiny tutorial, lmk if you need help)
Jaime:
- Maybe add context to the plots, especially regarding difference between new deaths, total cases, etc. (Might be my bad I know you had text previously
                                                                                                         but I didn't move it over when merging things)
- Small note but I also think the lines could be thicker, especially when it's just one on a plot I think it could jump out more



Random thoughts for presentation planning (not immediately important):
- Maybe we should plan a set of countries to specifically look at that looks interesting/damning to look at?
- Adding a separate tab for contextual information could be helpful to establish an opening for our story (... and eat up some time)
